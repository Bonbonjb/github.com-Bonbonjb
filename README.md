### 🌟 About Me

I'm a data-driven developer with a background in Petroleum Engineering, now transitioning into backend development. My journey started with self-taught data analysis—transforming raw data into actionable insights—and has grown into building powerful backend systems using Python, SQL, and Flask.

🔍 I love crafting clean APIs, managing databases, and designing the logic that powers impactful applications. Whether I'm analyzing customer churn, automating a process, or optimizing server-side functionality, I bring a blend of analytical thinking and problem-solving to every project.

My goal? To create backend solutions that are not only functional but scalable, secure, and meaningful.
